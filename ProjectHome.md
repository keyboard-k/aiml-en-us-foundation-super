The S.U.P.E.R. AIML bot is the knowledge base for the CallMom BASIC virtual assistant.  This free software is NOT the same as the [Superbot Development Kit](http://alicebot.org/superbot.html).   This project is an AIML bot named S.U.P.E.R (Substantial Upgrade of Previous Example Robot).  It includes the bot brain in AIML 2.0, configuration files, and some AIML Sets and Maps.   The bot does not include any sample conversation data, nor are the categories sorted by activation count.

The S.U.P.E.R. AIML bot is designed specifically for mobile virtual assistant applications.  It includes AIML to access external web services through the `<sraix>` tag as well as a significant number of responses containing device actions through `<oob>` tags.  For an explanation of these and other features in the S.U.P.E.R. AIML bot, see the [AIML 2.0 Working Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNT25hJRyupcG51aO89UcQEiG-HkXRXusukADpFnDs4/pub).

The S.U.P.E.R. AIML bot may be run with [Program AB](https://code.google.com/p/program-ab/).
